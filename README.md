# RailHeads
3D printed Eurorack Rails for screwing on top of wood

## Summary
This is my RailHeads project. Making professional looking DIY Eurorack case builds is now simpler than ever.

If you have a wood case with no rails or you want to build a case - this is probably the perfect solution for you!

Don´t get scared of the amount of the text below. I just tried to tell you everything you needed to know for adding RailHeads to your cases.

If you don´t have a 3D printer, a local school, library or a community might be nearby :)
Also I can print it for you, if you want (shipping from the Czech Republic).

Cool, enjoy!

## Preparation
### Step 1: Choose Rails

This depends on the length of the case you want.
You will need to subtract 4HPs because of Caps.

*For example: I chose a case with 48HPs -> I will need to print 2 x 44HPs of Rails. For Rails I chose 2x R14HPA and 4x R16HPA*

### Step 2: Choose Heads

#### There are currently 4 different types of Rails.

*L0F0 - no lips, the corners are not rounded
L0F2 - no lips, the corners are rounded
L2F0 - 2 mm lip, the corners are not rounded
L2F2 - 2mm lip, the corners are rounded (My preference).*

You need to choose the same amount of HPs as the lenght of your case.

*For example: I chose a case with 48HPs -> I will need to print 2 x 48 HPs of Heads. I chose 6 x H16HP1L2F2*

### Step 3: Choose Caps

This depends on the type of heads you chose.

For Heads with no lip (L0F0 or L0F2) you need to print 4 x the Cap - C2HP1L0F0 or C2HP1L0F2

For Heads with a lip (L2F0 or L2F2) you need to print 2x the Right Cap (C2HP2L2F0R or C2HP2L2F2R) and 2x the Left Cap (C2HP2L2F0L or C2HP2L2F2L).

*For example: I chose a case with L2F2 Heads. I will need to print 2x C2HP2L2F2R and 2x C2HP2L2F2R Caps.*

## Slicing
Orientation

Please print in shown direction.
Rails and Caps laying down.
Heads standing up - if needed, add a brim.



## Post-Printing
### Cleanup

If you used a brim for Heads, cut it off with an exacto knife.
If you used glue or another adhesive on the build plate, clean it off the prints.

## Finally! Adding rails to your case.
### Step 1 - Screwing in Rails

Screw in the rails with M2.5 screws. You should leave 2 HPs of space on each side (10.16mm).
You don´t need to screw in all of the holes in the rails. Just 2 or 3 for each rail is fine.

### Step 2: Sliding on Heads

Slide the Heads on Rails. It should be a pretty tight fit. Use a rubber hammer or another softer thing to slide it on the Rails.
Try to line up the screws in Rails with the holes in the Heads, so you can see it through.
The Heads will have the no Rails on 2HPs on every side.

### Step 3: Adding the Caps

Now put in the square nuts and close it up with the caps.
Pay attention with Lip Caps so you match the right Cap with a head.

Left cap means it goes on the top left and bottom right of the rails.
Right cap means it goes on the top right and bottom left of the rails.

Congrats! Enjoy your case.
If you made it here, your a champ!

Thanks a lot for making it this far. I hope your RailHead build went great.
